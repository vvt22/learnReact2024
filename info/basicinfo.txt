Q: Difference between a Library and Framework?
A: A library is a collection of packages that perform specific operations 
whereas a framework contains the basic flow and architecture of an application. 
The major difference between them is the complexity. Libraries contain a number of methods 
that a developer can just call whenever they write code. 
React js is library and Angular is Framework. 
The framework provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer 
what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required. 
If a library is used, the application calls the code from the library.

Q: What is async and defer?
A: Async - The async attribute is a boolean attribute. 
The script is downloaded in parallel(in the background) to parsing the page, 
and executed as soon as it is available (do not block HTML DOM construction during downloading process)
 and donâ€™t wait for anything.
Syntax: <script src="demo_async.js" async></script>

Defer - The defer attribute is a boolean attribute. 
The script is downloaded in parallel(in the background) to parsing the page, 
and executed after the page has finished parsing(when browser finished DOM construction). 
The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. 
Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM.
Syntax
<script src="demo_defer.js" defer></script>
